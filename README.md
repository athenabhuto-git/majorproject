# Multimodal Sentiment Analysis System 🎭

## 📌 Overview
This project was developed during my **final year BTech** as a **Major Project**.  
It is a **Multimodal Sentiment Analysis System** that analyzes human emotions and sentiments from multiple types of inputs:  

- 🖼️ **Images**  
- 🎥 **Videos**  
- 🎵 **Audio files**  
- 📝 **Text**

By combining different input modalities, the system provides a more accurate and reliable sentiment detection.
